<title>Vector-Based Coloring Method for Grid Networks</title>
<body>
<h1>Vector-Based Coloring Method</h1>

<p>
The Vector-Based Coloring Method, is a coloring method developped for
dense sensor network organized as grids.</p>

<p>
The coloring is a h-hop coloring, which can be typically used to allow MAC
access without collisions (e.g. can be used for a TDMA with spatial reuse).
</p>

<p>
The motivation is that when precise measurements of a physical phenomenon are 
made with sensors, it is natural to have a high density of sensor networks;
moreover, for ease of deployment and for further numerical analysis
(finite element methods, etc.), organizing them in a grid is often a 
good choice.
</p>

<p>
The main point of the method is that the color of each node can be
computed quickly from the nodes coordinates in the grid (rather than
running an coloring protocol), and most importantly with very little memory use,
given that most sensor nodes are considerably limited by memory (RAM):
color computation is performed with few integer arithmetic operations on a few
bytes (method VCM-NCC2).

We have computed
a <a href="optimal-vectors.html">table of some optimal vectors</a> 
(with figures of some colorings).

<h1>Example coloring</h1>

Here is a sample coloring with
<ul>
<li>h = 2, R = 3</li>
<li>Optimal vectors (for periodic coloring): <br>
<tt>u1=(5,3) u2=(-1,6)</tt> yielding <tt>33</tt> colors.
<li>With VCM-NCC2, the color of one point at (x,y) is given by <tt>c</tt>
(integer with 0 &le; c &lt; 33)
computed as follows:
<pre>
c1 = 6*x-(-1*y)
c2 = -(3*x)+5*y
ap = c1 // 33
bp = c2 // 33
xc = ap % 1
yc = bp % 1
xx = c1 % 33
c = xx + 33 * (xc + 1 * yc)
</pre>
<!-- yy = c2 % 33   (not used) -->
where '//' is integer division (quotient), '%' is modulo (remainder, must be >=0).<br>
Note: here u1 and u2 are a specific because gcd(5,3)=1 and gcd(1,6)=1
hence xc=0,yc=0.
</li>
